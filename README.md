# License Pool(Smart Contract to create license for your digital content)

## Introduction
The License Pool is designed to facilitate the creation, management, and transactions of licenses on the SUI blockchain. It provides a decentralized way to handle licenses for digital content, ensuring transparency and security.

This is a blockchain smart contract for managing licenses on the SUI blockchain. There are lot of digital contents are available right now on internet like video,audio.image,songs,art etc, but sometimes the actual creater and owner of the content dont get any recognition and royalty while other people are using it for free without giving him/her any credit, I tried to write a smart contract to create license for this types of digital content so that the creaters/owners can get recognition and get some royalty also when others people are using it for their work. This can also be helpful to track down people who are doing malicious activities with other people's work.

## Features

- Purchase new licenses
- Renew existing licenses
- Update license terms
- Deactivate licenses
- Retrieve license information

## Future Improvements
- track users using the content
- generate monthly audit for content
- strengthen security features
- maintaining a log and database to store all the contents

## Developers can create license having the following information:

-`name`</br>
-`address` (this is the Sui address of the developer)</br>
-`content_url`(this is url of the digital content)</br>
-`license terms` (this is where developers briefly mention the terms of license)</br>
-`royalty agreement`(the agreement between owner and other parties)</br>
-`is_active` (this field shows if the license is active or not)


### Prerequisites

- SUI blockchain environment
- Move language compiler

### Installation

Clone the repository and deploy the smart contract on the SUI blockchain.

### How to set up the project.
```bash

```
### I tried to deploy the project but I was facing some problems which I didn't understand, But the explained my idea, and in my code you can see what I am trying to do. Not able to deploy today but I will master move on sui and deploy this after hackathon for sure!!!
